Now I will provide you 
1. the .toc file of the .toe Touch Designer patch 
2. all the ascii files generated by toeexpand.exe binary, they are concatenated in one .txt file  in the following format:
<file_name>
<content of the file>
-------------------------------
<next file_name>
<content of the next file>

And so on until the end

3. a screenshot of the patch

can you use this information and generate the documentation of the patch?
