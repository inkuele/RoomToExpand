# RoomToExpand

## Room To Expand Files

This repository collects all the files from the Room to Expand workshop.
The files are mostly TouchDesigner patches that use the Kinect Azure camera to track human movement and generate visual and audio events.

In one case, the audio generation is done with an external software, SuperCollider, which receives the data as OSC from TouchDesigner.

The first commit was allowed to upload video and audio files because they are useful for making the patch work.
There is no version control on the audio files, unless explicitly changed by a git user.

### TODO:
- [ ] Add information about how to install TouchDesigner and SuperCollider, including which version and how to configure the software on Windows 11
- [ ] Add documentation for every patch. In progress, see below
- [ ] Include possible troubleshooting

# Documentation Generation Process

This documentation is generated using an automated system to handle TouchDesigner patches, which are saved in binary `.toe` format and cannot be directly read by ChatGPT. By expanding the `.toe` file into a collection of ASCII-readable files, we can process and document its content.

### Requirements
- [Toeexpand utility](https://derivative.ca/UserGuide/Toeexpand) by Derivative
- Scripts provided in the `Documentation/Scripts` folder

### Steps

1. **Convert the `.toe` File**  
   Use the `toeexpand` binary to convert the `.toe` file into a collection of readable ASCII files.
   - Replace `<path_to_toeexpand_binary>` with the actual path to `toeexpand.exe`.
   - **Example (Windows)**:
     ```bash
     C:\Program Files\Derivative\TouchDesignerxxx\bin\toeexpand.exe 1_smoke-fire-body.toe
     ```

2. **Take a Screenshot of the Patch**  
   Open the `.toe` file in TouchDesigner and take a screenshot of the main patch layout to visually represent its structure.

3. **Concatenate ASCII Files**  
   Use the `concat_dir_files.py` script to concatenate the collection of ASCII-readable files generated by `toeexpand` into one text file.
   - Run the following from the `Documentation/Scripts` folder:
     ```bash
     python concat_dir_files.py <path_to_expanded_dir>
     ```

4. **Batch Conversion of Multiple Patches**  
   Use `batch_concat.sh` to process all `.dir` directories in the `Documentation` folder and convert them into individual `.txt` files.
   - Run the following from the `Documentation/Scripts` folder:
     ```bash
     ./batch_concat.sh
     ```

5. **Submit Files to ChatGPT for Documentation**  
   Use the prompt suggestions in the `Documentation/Prompts` folder and upload the `.txt` file, `.toc` file, and screenshot of each patch to ChatGPT for documentation generation.
